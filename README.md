# multiply_with_occurrence

This algorithm parses the input string character by character, keeping track of the parentheses. It reverses the segments of the text that are outside of parentheses while preserving the order of text inside the parentheses, even when nested. The algorithm also ensures correct placement of punctuation marks in relation to the parentheses.
